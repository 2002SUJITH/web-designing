html :5 or ! (emmet abrevation) to build base structure

Emmet is a plugin for text editors, such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text,
 that provides a shorthand syntax for quickly writing HTML, CSS, and other code.
 With Emmet, you can write abbreviations that automatically expand
 into full HTML or CSS code.

 h1,h2,...,h6 tags
 _________________
h1 represents the highest level of heading,
and is typically used for the main heading or 
title of a web page.

h2 represents the second-highest level of heading and
can be used for subheadings or sub-titles within a web page.

h3, h4, h5, and h6 represent decreasing levels of headings,
and can be used to further divide and organize the content of a web page.
    

    ****The building blocks of HTML are tags, elements, and attributes.****
        _______________________________________________________________

1.Tags:-> are the building blocks of HTML. 
They define the structure and content of a web page.
Each tag is surrounded by angle brackets < and >, and has a corresponding 
closing tag that starts with a forward slash </. For example, the <p> tag 
defines a paragraph, and the closing tag </p> defines the end of the paragraph.

2.Elements :-> are the complete structure created by an opening and closing tag,
 including any content inside the tags. For example, a paragraph element might 
 look like this:   <p>This is a sample paragraph.</p>

3. Attributes:-> are additional information added to a tag to provide extra details 
or specific instructions. Attributes are written inside the opening tag and consist
of a name and a value, separated by an equal sign = and surrounded by quotes.
For example, the class attribute can be used to specify the style class for an element,
like this: <p class="highlight">This is a highlighted paragraph.</p>
    In this example, the class attribute has a value of "highlight", which is used by the CSS stylesheet to
apply specific styles to this element. Attributes are optional, and the number and type of attributes used
in a tag depends on the purpose of the tag.
