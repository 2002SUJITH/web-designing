                <h2><b> IHRD</b></h2>
                <p>The Institute of Human Resources Development (IHRD) was
                    established by the Government of Kerala (India) in 1987,
                    with the institutional centre at Thiruvananthapuram. IHRD
                    has grown within a short period into a network of more than
                    50 institutions. In addition to regular courses of study in
                    academic establishments, IHRD also runs short and long-term
                    employment oriented and continuing education programmes.

                    The first name of IHRD was Institute of Human Resources
                    Development for Electronics (IHRDE). Later it was renamed
                    and now bears the name IHRD.

                    IHRD founded and manages many technical schools, engineering
                    colleges, polytechnics and applied science colleges.</p>
                IHRD coordinates 8 Engineering Colleges.
                <ul>
                    <li> Government Model Engineering College</li>

                <P> <b>Aswathy </b> <br>
                    Enrolled 2017 <br>
                    B.Tech, Computer Science And Engineering <br>
                    "An Overview of My College" <br><br>
                    Placement Experience : Campus placements are there. Students
                    can participate in the 7th semester. Companies like Infosys,
                    Cognizant and companies from technopark, Infopark etc also
                    conducts drives. Eligible students are provided required
                    training and assistance for participating in off-campus
                    drives and pool drives as well. Around 40 students are
                    placed per year. The average packages offered is around 3.5
                    LPA. The highest package attained is around 4.5 LPA. I did
                    get placed through an on-campus opportunity and the future
                    plan is to join there. <br> <br>

                    Remarks : I had applied to colleges under IHRD which
                    includes the Model Engineering College, College of
                    Engineering Chengannur and College of Engineering Attingal
                    (CEAL) and College of Engineering Adoor. When the results of
                    the first allotment came out, I got into CEAL. I temporarily
                    got admission into that college and waited for the next
                    allotment. I got into the college of Engineering Adoor in
                    the second allotment and I took admission permanently since
                    it was nearer to my place and I also got affordable hostel
                    facilities. Also, there were good and on-time public
                    transport services available. I got into the BTech Computer
                    Science stream in the Merit Quota. To get admission in the
                    first or second allotments themselves, you need a valid Keam
                    score and rank anywhere between 15000 and 25000 atleast. You
                    will be able to get into the merit quota with a good rank if
                    not getting into the management quota is also easy. The
                    faculties and student volunteers assisted me and my parents
                    on the counselling day.
