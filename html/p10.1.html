            Placement Experience : Campus placements are there. Students
            can participate in the 7th semester. Companies like Infosys,
            Cognizant and companies from technopark, Infopark etc also
            conducts drives. Eligible students are provided required
            training and assistance for participating in off-campus
            drives and pool drives as well. Around 40 students are
            placed per year. The average packages offered is around 3.5
            LPA. The highest package attained is around 4.5 LPA. I did
            get placed through an on-campus opportunity and the future
            plan is to join there. <br> <br>

            Remarks : I had applied to colleges under IHRD which
            includes the Model Engineering College, College of
            Engineering Chengannur and College of Engineering Attingal
            (CEAL) and College of Engineering Adoor. When the results of
            the first allotment came out, I got into CEAL. I temporarily
            got admission into that college and waited for the next
            allotment. I got into the college of Engineering Adoor in
            the second allotment and I took admission permanently since
            it was nearer to my place and I also got affordable hostel
            facilities. Also, there were good and on-time public
            transport services available. I got into the BTech Computer
            Science stream in the Merit Quota. To get admission in the
            first or second allotments themselves, you need a valid Keam
            score and rank anywhere between 15000 and 25000 atleast. You
            will be able to get into the merit quota with a good rank if
            not getting into the management quota is also easy. The
            faculties and student volunteers assisted me and my parents
            on the counselling day.

            Remarks : This is an oldest and well known Engineering
            College in Kerala since 1995. Initially it was under CUSAT
            University and by 2015 it was under Kerala Technical
            University. The Government College of Engineering, Adoor
            (CEA) is a college in Adoor, Pathanamthitta District,
            Kerala, India, located 3 km from the town centre at
            Manakala. It is affiliated with the APJ Abdul Kalam
            Technological University and is run under the aegis of the
            Institute of Human Resources Development, an institute of
            the government of Kerala. The College was inaugurated in
            1995 by the Chief Minister of Kerala A K Antony. College of
            Engineering Adoor is recognized by the All India Council for
            Technical Education (AICTE). Recently the college has been
            selected in Technical Education Quality Improvement
            Programme (TEQIP) Phase II. It is one of the major
            engineering colleges in Pathanamthitta District and is one
            of the eight engineering colleges in the District. <br> <br>
            Admission : Admissions are carried out on the basis of the
            ranks obtained in the All Kerala Common Entrance
            Examinations, conducted by the Controller of Entrance
            Examinations, Government of Kerala. The college follows a
            50-50 method of admission from both merit and management
            streams. A significant number of students in the management
            stream is filled by children of NRIs.[citation needed]When
            the college started in 1995, it had a 90-10 breakup of merit
            and management streams. However, the merit students were
            required to pay a refundable deposit (at the end of the
            course) of one hundred thousand rupees which was utilized
            for infrastructure development in the college.
