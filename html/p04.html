        <h1>WEB DESIGNING</h1>
        <p>
            Web Designing is the process of creating visually appealing and
            user-friendly websites that effectively communicate with an
            audience. It encompasses a wide range of elements, including
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>graphic design</li>
            <li>typography</li>
            <li>color</li>
            <li>user experience (UX)</li>
            <li>user interface (UI)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li> <b>Graphic Design: </b>
                <br>
                This involves the use of images, illustrations, and other visual
                elements to enhance the overall look and feel of a website.</li>
            <li> <b> Typography: </b>
                <br>
                This refers to the style, size, and arrangement of text on a
                website. Effective typography can make a website more readable
                and visually appealing.</li>
            <li> <b> Color:</b>
                <br>
                The use of color is an important aspect of web design. Color can
                evoke emotions, convey a message, and create a visual hierarchy
                on a website.</li>
            <li> <b> User Experience (UX) Design: </b>
                <br>
                This focuses on the overall experience of a user when
                interacting with a website. It involves understanding user
                behavior, preferences, and goals to create a website that is
                easy to use and provides a positive experience.</li>
            <li> <b> User Interface (UI) Design:</b>
                <br>
                This involves the design of the elements that a user interacts
                with on a website, such as buttons, forms, and navigation. The
                goal of UI design is to create a website that is intuitive and
                easy to use.</li>
        </ol>

<!--
       The <sup> tag in HTML is used to define superscript text. Superscript text is written in a smaller font size and is positioned slightly higher than the normal text, usually to indicate a footnote or to express mathematical expressions. The text enclosed within the <sup> tag will be displayed as superscript.
        example <p>square of 5 = 5<sup>2</sup>=25</p>

    <style>
            body {
                background-color: #c589514d;
                font-style: italic;
                font-size: larger;
                color:rgb(55, 51, 51)
        }
      </style>
    The CSS code defines the style for a webpage. It sets the background color to a translucent light brown color, the font style to italic, the font size to larger, and the text color to a dark gray color. The style will be applied to the entire body element of the HTML document.
