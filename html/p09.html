<!--

    INLINE ELEMENTS AND BLOCK LEVEL ELEMENTS
    ----------------------------------------
Inline elements are used to define a small piece of content within a block-level element and only take up as much width as necessary. Examples of inline elements are: <a>, <span>, <em>, <strong>, etc.

Block-level elements are used to define a larger block of content that takes up the full width of its parent container and creates a new line after it. Examples of block-level elements are: <div>, <h1>, <p>, <ul>, etc.
